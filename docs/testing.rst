Testing
=======

The project includes a set of tests to verify functionality. To run the tests:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest tests/

The `tests/` directory contains dummy data in `tests/test.csv` for validating the core functions, including vorticity processing and period detection.

Make sure to review the tests and dummy data to understand how the system behaves with sample input.
