# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [1.9.0] - 2024-10-28

### New Features
- **Hemisphere Support Argument**: Added `hemisphere` argument in `determine_periods` function. This enables users to specify `southern` or `northern` hemisphere data, with automatic sign inversion for the northern hemisphere. Improved compatibility with wind data by setting this option to "northern".

### Documentation Improvements
- **Detailed Argument Descriptions**: Updated the `determine_periods` and `process_vorticity` functions' documentation to include specific units, guidelines, and recommendations for each parameter, enhancing usability.
- **Parameter Recommendations**:
  - `use_filter`: Added usage guidelines based on data type and frequency. For example, recommended setting `use_filter='auto'` for ERA5 data.
  - `replace_endpoints_with_lowpass`: Recommended setting a 24-hour window for hourly vorticity data.
  - `use_smoothing` and `use_smoothing_twice`: Added detailed behavior of 'auto' settings and recommendations based on noise levels.
  - `savgol_polynomial`: Explained ideal usage for smoothing based on noise level.
  - `cutoff_low` and `cutoff_high`: Provided guidance for optimal values to filter out planetary and mesoscale influences in vorticity data.
- **Additional Usage Recommendations**: Included cases for using alternative data types like SLP and wind speed and noted expected behavior with phase transitions.
- **Error and Warning Details**: Updated documentation to clarify error conditions related to parameter constraints, particularly for `use_smoothing` and `savgol_polynomial`.

### Code Adjustments
- **Spurious Oscillations Warning**: Added functionality to check for spurious oscillations at the start and end of filtered data, with a warning suggesting adjustments to `use_filter`, `replace_endpoints_with_lowpass`, or `use_smoothing` if detected.
- **`use_filter` Activation**: Clarified that passing an integer as the window length is necessary for activation.
- **Optional Smoothing**: Adjusted `use_smoothing` and `use_smoothing_twice` logic to handle `False` as a deactivation option, bypassing the smoothing process when set to `False`.
- **Savgol Parameter Warnings**: Implemented a check to raise an error if `savgol` window length is smaller than `savgol_polynomial`, ensuring valid parameter configurations.

### Testing Enhancements
- **Output Verification in Tests**: Enhanced test cases to check not only for successful execution but also for expected output consistency. Created expected results for different configurations (`use_filter`, smoothing parameters, and hemisphere adjustments) and verified test output matches these expected results.
- **Suppression of Specific Warnings**: Suppressed spurious oscillation warnings in test cases to reduce unnecessary output during testing.

### Bug Fixes
- **Normalization Clarification**: Resolved confusion regarding normalization in plots by noting that visualization normalization does not impact the core data analysis.


## [1.8.11] - 2024-10-19

### Documentation Update
- Clarified in the **API documentation** and **Usage Guide** that the `series` argument in the `determine_periods` function does not need to be in a specific unit.

## [1.8.10] - 2024-10-18

### Environment and Dependencies

- **Dependency Conflicts Resolved**: Fixed multiple dependency conflicts that were causing failures during installation.
  - Updated `requirements.txt` and `Pipfile` to include all necessary packages and correct versions.
  - Added missing packages like `virtualenv`, `pipenv`, and other dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

## [1.8.7] - 2024-10-18

### Bug Fixes and Improvements
- **Resolved Legend Color Duplication Issue**: Updated the `plot_all_periods` function to handle multiple occurrences of the same phase (e.g., "intensification", "decay") and ensure that the phase is displayed only once in the legend, regardless of how many times it appears.
  - Generalized the phase handling so that it can manage any number of phase repetitions (e.g., "intensification 2", "mature 3") without affecting the plotâ€™s visual integrity.
  - Fixed the issue with the residual phase showing the wrong color by ensuring that colors for phases are correctly mapped in all cases.
  
### Documentation Updates
- **Added Statement of Need Section**: Incorporated the Statement of Need from the paper into the documentation, explaining the relevance and purpose of the CycloPhaser package, along with detailed references.

  - Replaced the figures in the `usage.rst` for the ones with the corrected colors.
  - Updated the example in the documentation to use the new structure for accessing the test data
  
### Package Management
- **Added Dependencies to `setup.py`**: Ensured all necessary dependencies are included in the `setup.py` file, resolving the issue of missing dependencies when installing the package via `pip install cyclophaser`.
  - Verified that all dependencies are correctly installed when the package is installed using pip.

### Test Data Accessibility
- **Made Test CSV File Accessible from the Package**: Moved the example test data (`example_file.csv`) to be accessible from the installed package under the `cyclophaser` directory, ensuring that users can run examples without needing to modify paths manually.
  - Updated the usage examples to reflect the new accessible path for the test file.

### Other Improvements
- **Updated Column Names in Example**: Corrected the column name in the example provided in the `usage.rst` to `min_max_zeta_850` (previously `min_zeta_850`), ensuring that the example code runs successfully with the test data provided.
